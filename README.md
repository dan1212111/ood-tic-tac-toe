# Tic Tac Toe!

This is a very common tech test as it demonstrates a candidate's knowledge of basic data structures.

## The brief

The rules of tic-tac-toe are as follows:

* There are two symbols in the game (default `x` and `o`)
* Players take turns until the game is over
* A player can claim a field if it is not already taken
* A player wins if they claim all the fields in a row, column or diagonal
* A game is over if a player wins or when all fields are taken

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement 
a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.


// Create a board class with 1-9 spaces 

// Have I won checker if not it's the next players turn 


// If game is null - restart

// 2 seperate Do move - with seperate inputs threw constructor.
